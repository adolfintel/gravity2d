# Gravity 2D
Create a sun, spin some asteroids around it, and watch them collide and form planets.

Gravity 2D is a Multithread N-Point Gravity Simulator.

An N-Point Gravity Simulator is a realistic simulation in which all points attract each other: even the smallest asteroid has its own gravitational field that can affect even a large sun far away from it.

Can be reused as a library for making games. 

## Usage
If you just want to play around with the simulator, you can download it from [here](http://adolfintel.com/?p=gravity2d/index.frag). It requires [Java](http://java.com) to run.

If you want to use it as a library or tinker with the code, download the project and import it into Netbeans.

## Compatibility
Multiplaform, Java SE 7
